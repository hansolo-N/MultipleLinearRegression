## Objective
The objective of this project is to build a multiple linear regression model to predict expected profits based on 50 startup businesses and their expenditures in various budgets, namely R&D spend, administration and Marketing spend.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Import the dataset.
   - Check for missing values and handle them if necessary.
   - Perform any necessary data transformations or feature scaling.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualize the relationship between the two vectors, namely y_pred and y_test vectors.
   - Check for any outliers or anomalies in the data.
   - Explore any other relevant insights from the data.

3. **Model Building**:
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
   - Build a simple multiple linear regression model using the training data.
   - Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., mean squared error, R-squared).

4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Assess the model's performance on the testing set.
   - Visualize the model's predictions versus the actual values.
   - Interpret the model coefficients and any other relevant insights.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Summarize the findings of the project.
   - Discuss any limitations of the model and areas for further improvement.
